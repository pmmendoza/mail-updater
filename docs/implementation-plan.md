# Mail Updater Implementation Plan

This document captures the remaining work required to turn the `mail-updater` repository into a fully functional product. The plan is structured around the seven major steps identified previously. For each step we outline the overarching goal, why the step matters, the requirements that must be satisfied, and the Definition of Done (DoD). Priority levels indicate whether a step is **Crucial**, **Important**, or **Nice to Have** for a successful launch.

## Status Update — 2025-10-20

- ✅ **MVP prototype**: CLI scaffolding, compliance snapshot logic, participant roster management, and Qualtrics sync have landed. The README now documents setup, the new `validate-participants` command, and the fixture workflow.
- ✅ **Tooling/tests**: `make lint`/`make test` targets, compliance snapshot unit tests, and a reusable SQLite fixture support local verification.
- ✅ **Qualtrics integration**: Python-based sync replaces the R script; a CLI command (`sync-participants`) plus tests and docs are in place.
- ✅ **Requirements & ops docs**: Drafted `docs/requirements.md`, `docs/operations.md`, and `docs/maintenance.md` covering MVP scope and runbooks.
- ⏳ **Next focus**: stakeholder review/sign-off for requirements (Step 1) and implementation of deployment automation (Step 7).

## 1. Collect and Document Product Requirements (Crucial)

### Goal & Motivation
* Establish clear expectations for what "mail-updater" must accomplish, covering workflows, integrations, and success metrics.
* Align stakeholders on scope before implementation begins to prevent rework and scope creep.

### Requirements
* Conduct stakeholder interviews to gather functional workflows (CLI, API, automation) and data model expectations.
* Capture non-functional needs such as authentication, security/compliance constraints, performance targets, and operational considerations.
* Identify external dependencies (mail provider APIs, databases, messaging systems) and access prerequisites.
* Document the above in a new `docs/requirements.md` with user stories and explicit acceptance criteria.
* Secure stakeholder review and sign-off to freeze scope for the initial release.

### Definition of Done
* `docs/requirements.md` exists and is approved by relevant stakeholders.
* Requirements document clearly enumerates user stories, constraints, dependencies, and success metrics.
* Open questions are tracked with owners and resolution dates.

## 2. Establish Project Scaffold and Tooling (Crucial)

### Goal & Motivation
* Select a technology stack aligned with requirements and create a maintainable foundation for development.
* Ensure developers have consistent tooling for building, testing, and formatting the codebase from day one.

### Requirements
* Decide on runtime language/framework (e.g., Python with FastAPI/Click, Node.js, etc.) considering team expertise and integration needs.
* Document architectural rationale and chosen stack in `docs/architecture.md`.
* Initialize repository structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `configs/`, `docs/`) and package management files (e.g., `pyproject.toml` or `package.json`).
* Configure baseline tooling: formatter, linter, type checker, task runner, and CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions workflow).
* Provide setup instructions for virtual environments or containerized development.

### Definition of Done
* Project tree contains standardized directories and build tooling.
* Dependency management and environment setup instructions are documented and tested locally.
* CI pipeline executes linting, formatting, and test jobs on every push.

## 3. Model Domain Entities and Persistence (Crucial)

### Goal & Motivation
* Define and implement the core data structures representing messages, recipients, update policies, scheduling, and status tracking.
* Prepare the persistence layer to reliably store and retrieve application state.

### Requirements
* Produce entity diagrams and narrative in `docs/data-model.md` describing key entities and relationships.
* Implement domain models in the source tree (e.g., `src/mail_updater/models.py` or similar) including serialization/deserialization logic.
* Choose persistence strategy (database with ORM, file-based store, etc.) and outline migration/versioning approach.
* Provide initial seed or fixture data to support local development and automated tests.

### Definition of Done
* Data models are implemented with accompanying unit tests validating schema and serialization logic.
* Persistence layer is operational locally with reproducible setup instructions.
* Data model documentation is in sync with implemented code.

## 4. Develop Mail Update Workflows (Crucial)

### Goal & Motivation
* Build the core business logic that performs mail updates, orchestrates scheduling/triggers, and handles integrations.
* Expose the application via the agreed interfaces (CLI, API, background workers).

### Requirements
* Implement service-layer modules (e.g., `src/mail_updater/services/`) encapsulating update logic, error handling, and retries.
* Connect to external systems (mail APIs, configuration sources) with robust error handling and abstractions for testing.
* Implement chosen interfaces: CLI commands under `src/mail_updater/cli.py`, REST endpoints under `src/mail_updater/api.py`, or equivalent.
* Establish configuration management (e.g., YAML, environment variables) with validation and sensible defaults in `configs/`.
* Include logging instrumentation and event hooks to aid observability.

### Definition of Done
* Core update workflows execute successfully using configuration files or CLI flags in a local environment.
* Interfaces expose required commands/endpoints with documentation and examples.
* Error handling, retries, and logging meet documented requirements.

## 5. Build Automated Test Suite (Crucial)

### Goal & Motivation
* Guarantee reliability and prevent regressions by covering the system with automated tests.
* Enable continuous integration to provide rapid feedback to developers.

### Requirements
* Configure test runner (pytest, Jest, etc.) and supporting fixtures/mocks for external dependencies in the `tests/` directory.
* Write unit tests for models, services, and interfaces covering both happy paths and edge cases.
* Add integration tests that simulate end-to-end update flows using mock/staging services.
* Document how to run the test suite locally and ensure CI executes it automatically.

### Definition of Done
* Test suite runs cleanly locally and in CI with comprehensive coverage of critical features.
* Developers have clear guidance on adding new tests and verifying results.
* Code coverage thresholds (if adopted) are met or exceeded.

## 6. Document Usage, Maintenance, and Glossary (Important)

### Goal & Motivation
* Provide developers and operators with actionable documentation to set up, run, and maintain the application.
* Deliver concise definitions for domain terminology and a "mark-done" checklist to track readiness.

### Requirements
* Author `README.md` detailing project overview, setup steps, configuration, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.
* Create `docs/operations.md` describing deployment playbooks, monitoring, incident response, and a Definition of Done checklist to mark when work streams are complete.
* Include a glossary of short definitions for domain-specific terms, either within README or a dedicated section/file.
* Supply diagrams or sequence charts when helpful to explain complex workflows.

### Definition of Done
* Documentation enables a new contributor to set up the project, run tests, and exercise main functionality without additional guidance.
* Glossary covers key terms, and Definition of Done checklist is actionable and current.
* Documentation is kept in sync with code changes via review process.

## 7. Finalize Deployment and Support Readiness (Important)

### Goal & Motivation
* Ensure the application can be deployed, observed, and supported in target environments.
* Establish operational practices for ongoing maintenance and releases.

### Requirements
* Provide deployment artifacts (Dockerfile, docker-compose, Kubernetes manifests, or infrastructure-as-code) validated in staging-like environments.
* Integrate logging, metrics, and alerting mechanisms; document access instructions for observability tools.
* Define maintenance routines, release/versioning strategy, and SLA expectations in `docs/maintenance.md`.
* Capture onboarding steps for support personnel and escalation paths.

### Definition of Done
* Deployment pipeline can build, publish, and deploy the application reproducibly.
* Observability stack captures key metrics/logs, with alert thresholds documented.
* Maintenance and support documentation is approved by stakeholders.

## Verification Snippets

Once all steps above are completed, the following example commands should succeed without errors (adjust paths/tooling to the chosen stack):

```bash
# Set up environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]

# Run automated checks
pytest            # unit/integration tests
ruff check src    # lint (if using Ruff)
mypy src          # static typing (if using MyPy)

# Exercise CLI
mail-updater sync --dry-run --config configs/dev.yaml

# Launch API locally (if applicable)
uvicorn mail_updater.api:app --reload
```

These commands provide a quick health check to confirm that the repository is fully functional.
