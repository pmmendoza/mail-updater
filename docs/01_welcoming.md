Dear participant,

Thank you for helping us develop a better future for news on social media üôè.

You have now completed the sign-up phase.

*What now?*
Over the next 14 days you can use our curated Bluesky Newsfeed.
You can use it as much as you would like but to complete the study participation requirements we expect you to:
1. Use the feed at least once per day.
2. Engage (like, comment, repost) at least one news post a day.

*What if I miss a day?*
You can miss a couple of days as long as you:
1. Don't skip more than two days in a row.
2. Don't skip more than four days overall

As you may want to keep track of your progress, we have set up this email channel through which we can send you a daily progress update.

*And after these 14 days?*
When the 14 days are over and you have completed our participation requirements, we will invite you to the post-treatment survey where we collect your feedback to finalize your study participation.


Warm regards,


```
